# Linux Scripts 

This repository is a collection of some scripts needed to make work easier on Linux subsystem environments(MinGW, MSYS, CygWin, etc.).
Each script and config file is individual and have no logical connections directly.

## Git Related Scripts

These scripts (glo, gloa, gss) usually declared as alias in Linux OSs'. My system has Msys2, CygWin and Git Bash environments and they are
isolated to each other. To reduce alias declarations add them as scripts with Windows PATH.
